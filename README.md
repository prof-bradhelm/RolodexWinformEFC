# RolodexWinformEFC
CSCI 1261 Teaching Project - Windows Forms Rolodex w/Entity Framework Core

Due to the SARS-COVID-19 virus pandemic of 2020, we are teaching many of our class online
including the programming classes.

This particular project is designed to use Visual STudio 2019 Community Edition to create
a Windows Forms Application (.NET 4.7.2) using Entity Framework Core 3.1.3 for database
connectivity.
